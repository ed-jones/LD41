# Dunk Four

**Ever wondered what combining basketball and connect four would look like?**

**Wonder no longer!**

Dunk Four is a 2 player game where the objective is to connect four of the same coloured balls in a line, be it vertically, horizontally or even diagonally! The added difficulty comes from the requirement to flick the ball into the desired column, a truly challenging feat.
